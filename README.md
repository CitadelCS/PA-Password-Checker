This is a shell for Java autograder assignments with test classes for
GitHub Classroom with codespaces and maven. It requires a newer version
of maven compatible with Java 17. It works locally.

Refactor App.java to the main file for the assignment.
Refactor AppTest and AnotherAppTest to be unit tests.
In GitHub Classroom, add `mvn test -Dtest=AppTest` to run the first, and
`mvn test -Dtest=AnotherAppTest` to run the second. Creat additional
files full of tests for additional partial credit.
